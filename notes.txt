ElsaticSearch : developed in java programming lang 
highly scalable document storage engine 
=> perform detailed analysis and store all data centrally 
=> document based , instead of schemes and tables , 
===============> using ElsaticSearch as a NoSQL Database <======================
*/perform and combine verious types of data
*/ you can retireve the result from the data
*/allawys th eusers to ask the query anayway they want 

*/takes care  both of th analysis and query on data
*/ helps to complete the search query based on the previous searches
===============> DIffernet usages of ElsaticSearch <======================
--->Textual search
---> product search
--->geo search
--->dat aaggregation
--->auto seguestion
--->auto complete
---> Json document storage
--->Metrics and analysis
======++++> Where can it be used 
=> storage and analysis tool 
=> schema less nature> extracting the metrics from the incoming connection in real time 
===================================> Advantages of ElasticSearch ===============================
==> Running on everyplatforme because it uses java
==>offer the concept of the gateway , allaows for creating full backups easily
==> distibuted / document oriented / easy to scale up in a large organisations
==> documentaiton is available in differnet languages
==> FREEEEEEEEE X) 
==> supporting all document types , 

===================================> Disadvantages  of ElasticSearch ===============================
=> the split brain situations 
=> Not  a multilangual support for handeling request and response data
=> not a good datastore , : performs well for small cases , => chokes or loses the data
=> flexible and powerful data storage search engine , DIFFICULTE TO LEA>RN ( و لكن نحن لها يا هذاااااا) !
